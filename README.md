## Description

This assignment required me to complete six different tasks. First, I had to write a code that computes the Heaviside function, which is a piecewise function. Second, I had to write a more complex version of the piecewise function. Third, I had to write a code counting the number of a particular base pair in a DNA sequence. Fourth, I had to write a code that would print a histogram of a given set of data. The fifth task required me to print the same histogram but with a particular format. Finally, I had to write a code that counted the number of digits in a particular number. All of these exercises required me to use definitions and loops (for,if, and while).

## What I Learned from This

These exercises enhanced my understanding of loops as well as definitions and strings.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
